                  As a committed individual, taking pride in my 100% commitment to any task or interest. 
                  An example of this is that I have been raising money for charity from a very young age. In 2016, after 2 years of training, 
                  I cycled from Land’s End in Cornwall to John o’ Groats in Scotland, completing a total of 999 miles in 12 consecutive days. 
                  I successfully raised £7300 for three individual charities, Autoimmune Alopecia Research UK, Birmingham Children’s Hospital and Sandwell Young Carers. 
                  In addition, I set up a blog for the whole event and for the training attracting interest from BBC Midlands Today. 
                  There have been many other cycle events that I have completed, such as including Birmingham Bikeathon for Leukaemia and 
                  cycling for men’s cancer when I was 6 years of age, and I have raised money with family in other events, for example, Macmillan Cancer Support.
