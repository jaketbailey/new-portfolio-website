              I am an outgoing, approachable, enthusiastic, confident, self-motivated student and employee. I have recently achieved A-level Computer Science, Psychology and Maths. I am currently studying for a BSc(Hons) in Software Engineering at the University of Portsmouth.

              I am also learning the programming language 'Go' by Google at home to extend my programming skills further. In the summer this year I am going to start learning the C programming language and TypeScript alongside Go both in preparation for Year 2 at university, but to also start some of my own projects other then work set for my course.

              In addition one of my interests is road cycling which helped me raise Â£7,300 for 3 local charities by cycling Lands End to John O'Groats in 12 days in 2016.
