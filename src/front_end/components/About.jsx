          <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>
              I am an outgoing and self-motivated student and employee. In June, I started my industrial placement as a Naval Ships Software Engineer at BAE Systems working with technologies such as Vue.js and MATLAB.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently studying for a BSc(Hons) in Software Engineering at the University of Portsmouth, in my 3rd (Placement Year) of my 4 year course.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work, I redeveloped my Portfolio site using Next.js, Bootstrap and Express.js, further developing my current skills within web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition one of my interests is road cycling which helped me raise Â£7,300 for 3 local charities by cycling Lands End to John O'Groats in 12 days in 2016.
